\textbf{Digital Object Identifiers: Concept DOI und Version DOI}

This data set is uniquely identified by Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). DOIs are persistent identifiers which are not only uniquely assigned, but can also be resolved by entering a DOI into the web service at \url{www.doi.org}. The DOI given in this document is a \emph{Version DOI}, which uniquely identifies Version \version. Academics and others who wish to enable replication analyses are strongly advised to cite the precise version of the data and its associated \emph{Version DOI}. A \emph{Concept DOI} is available from the page of the Zenodo record under the heading \enquote{Cite all versions?} and will always resolve to the latest version.
